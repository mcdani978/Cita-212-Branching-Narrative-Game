  strStoryText: "Near the end of Humanities 261 class. Landyn comes out of his daydream.
    As the lecture nears it end, he disrupts the silence with a very loud yawn. Professor
    Efimenko says welcome back Landyn which makes some of the students chuckle. Landyn
    says you won't belive it, but I just had the craziest day dream. Then Professor
    Efimenko says to him oh yeah what might that day dream have been about? Landyn
    says beleive it nor not I had a day dream about a weed zombie outbreak. While
    laughing Professor Efimenko says so what kind of wacky stuff were you puffing
    on before you came to class today? The entire class bursts into laughter. \n\n1.
