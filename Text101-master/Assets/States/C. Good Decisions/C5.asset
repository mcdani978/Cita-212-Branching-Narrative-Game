  strStoryText: "\uFEFF\r\n\r\nThe Weed Zombie problem has spread to the rest of
    the world. The weed zombies at Morrisville took seeds from the infected plants
    and grew more of them. Each infected plant reproduced and produced even more
    seeds. Drug dealers who didn't care about the side effects that the zombie weed
    had on people stole some seeds and spread them throughout New York state, which
    in turned spread to the rest of the United States, which in turn somehow spread
    to the whole world. Thus, causing the global weed zombie pandemic.\n\n1. Press
    1 to continue on with the story. \n"
