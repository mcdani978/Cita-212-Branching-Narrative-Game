  strStoryText: 'Morrisville students and other local weird people from around Morrisville
    buy Melvyn''s stolen and contaminated weed. The people who bought the weed within
    a day become super adicted to it and their body starts to deteriorate super-fast.
    After 24 their bodies fully resemble that of a zombie. But they don''t try to
    attack people like your average zombie these zombies are just very chill and
    smoke weed 24/7. The addictive effects of this zombie weed seem to be 1 million
    times stronger than that of meth or cocaine.


    1. 2 Weeks Pass.'
