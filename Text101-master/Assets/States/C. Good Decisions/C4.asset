    completely gotten out of hand at campus many students and local residents have
    turned into weed zombies the police can't contain it. Students are showing up
    to class now looking like zombies and bringing bongs with them and are literally
    smoking throughout the entire class. Some teachers who buy weed from Melvyn have
    turned into Weed Zombies. Everywhere you walk around campus now you can smell
    the stench of weed. As a result all Morrisville Classes have been cancelled until
    further notice. Also many weed zombies are raiding the greenhouse basement to
    steal even more weed.\n\n1. 1 year has passed now"
