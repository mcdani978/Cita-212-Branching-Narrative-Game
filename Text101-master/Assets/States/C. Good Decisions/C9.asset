  strStoryText: "\uFEFF\r\n\r\nBecause Frederick took over leadership at Morrisville
    when he did it did not fall. Attempts are being made to completely get rid of
    all contaminated weed on campus. Frederick made a new campus police force joined
    by many former campus police that did not turn into weed zombies and by anyone
    else who is still on campus and willing to do the job. Attempts are now being
    made by the campus police to get rid of all weed zombies on campus. There are
    also walls that are built around Morrisville now to keep the weed zombies out.
    Morrisville will now become a safe haven and a community where people can live.
    Similar to many of the gated-up communities in The Walking Dead tv show. Morrisville
    is attempting to set up more communities all over and communicate with any surviving
    group throughout New York State, The United States and the rest of the world
    on how to stop the on-slought of weed zombies and bring the world back to it's
    former glory eventually. \n\n1. Press 1 for the ending."
