The canoe race has started and the canoe we're supporting is off to a good start.

However, there are several more groups that haven't started yet. 
The war canoes are getting ready and it should be interesting to
see them launched.

What should we do?
1. Stay and watch the other groups launch their canoes.
2. Get in the car and head off to our first rendezvous point.
